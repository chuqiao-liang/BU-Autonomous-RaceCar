# BU-Autonomous-RaceCar

Developing an Autonomous Race Car

The project is structured in the following directories:

- actuation: actuation subsystem with raw servo and ESC interface
  controls
  
- PID: Controller that recieves continuous location & setpoint updates & calculates     
  steering and throttle outputs

- sensing: sensing subsystem with drivers and test code for sensors

- path_planning: application-level logic for environment exploration
  and path/waypoint generation strategies

- resources: everything else other than code: e.g. CAD drawings, extra
  documentation, experimental data-sets
